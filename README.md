# MyContainers 🗃️

**MyContainers** is a collection of C++ data structure implementations designed for educational purposes.  
The project focuses on **code transparency**, **implementation details**, and **learning examples** to help developers understand the inner mechanics of popular containers.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Simplicity and Readability**: Code is written with minimal optimizations to emphasize structural logic.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each container includes comments explaining key algorithms.
- **Tests and Examples**: Ready-to-use examples and unit tests for correctness verification.
- **STL-like API**: Interfaces closely mimic the Standard Template Library for easy transition.
